# Amethyst

Amethyst is a 5-Stage processor core based on Geode that adds L1 Instruction and Data caches.

Amethyst is written in Atlas/Python. [Atlas](https://github.com/medav/atlas) is a Python-embedded-HDL similar to Chisel/Scala. Note that at the time of this project's creation, Atlas is still in the very early stages of development.
